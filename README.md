Create a new Android project in Android Studio if you haven't already. You can select an Empty Activity template to start with a blank slate.

Set up Firebase for your Android project:

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
Connect your Android app to the Firebase project by clicking "Add App" and follow the setup instructions.
Download the google-services.json file and place it in your app module's directory (usually app/).

com.yourpackage is your app's package name. Replace this with your actual package name.
activities contains Kotlin classes for each of your app's activities, such as login, registration, the main app screen, campaign management, and user profiles.
adapters is where you store custom adapters for RecyclerViews or other UI elements.
models holds data models used in your app, such as user data, campaign details, and influencer information.
utils contains utility classes that might be needed throughout your app. For example, FirebaseUtils.kt can include functions for handling Firebase operations.
MyApplication.kt is your custom Application class for initializing Firebase, as shown in the previous response.
values includes resource files for defining colors, strings, and styles used in your app.
layout stores XML layout files for your app's activities and items used in RecyclerViews.
drawable holds XML vector drawable resources.
mipmap is where you place your app's launcher icons of various sizes.
This is a simplified structure to get you started. As your project grows, you may create additional directories and organize your code and resources according to your app's specific needs.

Remember to replace com.yourpackage with your actual package name, and adjust the names of activities, layouts, and other files to match your project's requirements.
